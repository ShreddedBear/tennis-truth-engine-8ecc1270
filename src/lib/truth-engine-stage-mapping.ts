// TRUTH ENGINE — MAPPING THE DETERMINISTIC AUDIT ONTO THE PERSISTED STAGE SCHEMA
//
// The deterministic engines (truth-engine-audit.ts) reason in EVIDENCE FAMILIES. The
// database persists per-rule (verification/disagreement), per-pathway (underdog) and
// per-test (stress) rows. This module is the honest bridge between the two.
//
// The governing principle: a row is only populated when the deterministic audit genuinely
// answers that specific rule/pathway/test. Every other row is written as an explicit
// UNAVAILABLE carrying the exact missing evidence -- never a fabricated finding, and never
// the audit's overall verdict copy-pasted into a rule it does not actually answer.
//
// That distinction matters: filling all 60 verification rows with the same summary would
// look "complete" while claiming 60 rules were evaluated when perhaps six were. The prior
// architecture's failure was exactly that kind of false completeness.

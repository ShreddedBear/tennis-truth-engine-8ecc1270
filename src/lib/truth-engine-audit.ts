// TRUTH ENGINE — DETERMINISTIC AUDIT LAYERS
//
// Verification, Disagreement, Underdog Pathways and Stress Testing, all computed from the
// SAME evidence the decision core already derives (truth-engine-metric-comparison.ts), with
// no AI call anywhere in this file.
//
// Why: the forensic audit (docs/audit-truth-engine-decision-core.md) found all four stages
// delegated wholly to the LLM researcher. Across 405 persisted runs they produced 0
// verification findings, 0 disagreement risks, 0 classified underdog pathways and 0
// stress winner_after values -- while still reporting COMPLETE, because a stage counts as
// complete once every row is *settled*, and a provider failure settles them all UNAVAILABLE.
//
// Design rules held throughout:
//  * One source of evidence truth. Every layer reads MetricComparison[]; none re-derives
//    numbers, so no layer can disagree with another about what the evidence says.
//  * Symmetry. Nothing is computed "for P1 then assumed inverse for P2". Swapping the two
//    players swaps every output (regression-tested).
//  * Evidence families vote once. Correlated metrics never inflate support OR contradiction.
//  * UNAVAILABLE is never 0 and never a lean for the side that does have data.
//  * Severity and viability are derived from measured magnitude against each metric's own
//    declared noise floor (its materiality), never from prose and never hardcoded.

 * numbers -- it is not evidence that the measured edge does not exist, and treating it as a
 * veto silently discarded selections the measured evidence does support. (The one genuine
 * reversal test that DOES refuse lives in the decision core: leave-one-family-out
 * recomputes the leader with each REAL family removed, and a real family that reverses the
 * leader means the call is contradicted by evidence actually in hand.)

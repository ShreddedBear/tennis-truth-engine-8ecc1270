// TRUTH ENGINE — DETERMINISTIC FINAL SELECTION
//
// Turns per-metric P1/P2 comparisons (truth-engine-metric-comparison.ts) into a
// defensible selection, or an explicit refusal. Pure: no DB, no network, no AI.
//
// This is deliberately NOT "the player with the most metrics wins":
//
//  * ANTI-DOUBLE-COUNTING. Correlated metrics are grouped into evidence FAMILIES and a
//    family votes exactly ONCE. Five agreeing metrics drawn from the same shared-opponent
//    pool are one piece of independent evidence, not five. A family whose own members
//    disagree is INTERNALLY_CONFLICTED and votes for nobody.
//
//  * INDEPENDENT SUPPORT AND INDEPENDENT CONTRADICTION are counted separately, so "one
//    dissent" cannot silently cancel a broad, genuinely independent consensus, and a
//    narrow consensus cannot bury a strong contradiction.
//
//  * LEAVE-ONE-FAMILY-OUT (LOFO) STABILITY is a real recomputation: the selection is
//    re-derived with each family removed in turn. If removing any single family flips the
//    leader, the result is FRAGILE and cannot be reported as a strong selection. This is
//    the stress test actually recalculating a decision input, not relabelling one.
//
//  * REFUSAL IS A FIRST-CLASS OUTCOME. Insufficient independent families, a tie, or a
//    contradiction that outweighs support all yield INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE with the reason
//    stated. Certainty is never forced.
//
// UNAVAILABLE comparisons are simply absent from every count. They are never zero, never
// neutral-in-favour-of-anyone, and never evidence for the side that does have data.

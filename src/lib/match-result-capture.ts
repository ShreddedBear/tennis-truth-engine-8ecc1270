// REAL-RESULT CAPTURE & RESOLUTION -- the path from a finished audit run to a graded
// observation, orchestrated through injected dependencies so the whole flow can be driven
// in memory by tests exactly the way the audit pipeline is.
//
//   completed run -> its match -> a verified final result -> matches.actual_winner
//     -> compare the engine's selected player against that winner -> WIN/LOSS, but ONLY
//        when the result is genuinely known.
//
// What this deliberately does not do:
//   * It never invents a result. The only thing that can populate a winner is `lookupResult`,
//     backed by real recorded match history -- never the prediction, never an LLM.
//   * It never lets evidence coverage, the active-metric registry or evidence support touch
//     the grade. Grading happens entirely inside resolvePredictionOutcome, which cannot see
//     any of them.
//   * It never produces a probability. A resolved observation is a WIN or a LOSS; turning a
//     population of those into calibrated probabilities is a later, separate job.

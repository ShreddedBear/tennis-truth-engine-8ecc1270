// THE ACTIVE TRUTH ENGINE METRIC SET — one definition, derived, never typed out.
//
// Two different denominators were being conflated in the audit UI, which is what made
// "P1 METRIC EXECUTION 51/81" misleading:
//
//   PROCESSING PROGRESS (x/81) — how many of the run's metric_results rows the processor
//   has TREATED for one side. All 81 defined codes are still instantiated and still
//   executed; a row counts as treated even when it ends UNAVAILABLE. This is a throughput
//   number, and it is also the P2 resume cursor, so it is deliberately left alone.
//
//   ACTIVE TRUTH ENGINE EVIDENCE (x/25) — how many of the codes that actually GRADE a match
//   produced genuinely usable, two-sided evidence. This is the readiness number.
//
// The denominator is the key set of COMPARISON_SPECS rather than a literal 25, because
// those specs are what the comparison layer actually uses to grade. Deriving it means the
// two can never drift: promoting a metric by adding its spec moves this denominator to 26
// in the same commit, and nothing else has to be edited. There is no "25" constant here.
//
// The other 56 codes are NOT excluded from the system by any of this. They stay in the
// processing universe, keep executing, and keep their evidence; they simply are not part of
// the graded set until a spec exists for them.

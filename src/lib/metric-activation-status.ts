// METRIC ACTIVATION STATUS -- machine-readable classification of WHY each side of each
// active metric ended up where it did, and whether that reason legitimately excuses the
// match from counting that metric in its evidence-coverage denominator.
//
// This is a pure, read-side classifier over fields the pipeline ALREADY persists
// (metric_results.p1_unavailable_reason/p2_unavailable_reason, whose values are the
// UnavailableReason enum audit-pipeline.ts's metricPairPatch already computes and writes).
// No schema change, no new column, no change to what gets persisted -- it only interprets
// what is already there into the coarser, decision-relevant taxonomy this audit needs.
//
// Two questions this answers for every (metric, side):
//   1. ActivationStatus -- the specific, named reason (for the audit trail).
//   2. Whether that status legitimately excuses this match from the metric's denominator
//      (countsAgainstCoverage: false) or is a real miss that should still be counted as a
//      failure to fix (countsAgainstCoverage: true).
//
// The three EXCUSED statuses (SOURCE_EMPTY, INSUFFICIENT_SAMPLE, GENUINELY_UNAVAILABLE) are
// only ever reached AFTER a genuine, evidenced attempt found nothing -- never assumed in
// advance, never used to avoid trying. That is what keeps a dynamic denominator honest
// rather than a way to make a low coverage number look better: nothing here removes a
// metric from the denominator until the pipeline has actually asked and gotten a real
// "there is nothing" answer.

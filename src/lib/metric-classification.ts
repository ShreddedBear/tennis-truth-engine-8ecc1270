// Canonical metric classification registry.
//
// Source of truth: public/seed/metrics.txt (the document that seeds the
// production `rules` table via src/lib/rule-parser.ts + src/lib/bootstrap.ts).
// Every code/name pair below was read directly from that file after fixing a
// heading-numbering collision (see git history on public/seed/metrics.txt —
// an embedded "120-Match Empirical Overlay" sub-section reused numbers
// 1/2/3/4/5/6 as its own local list, which the sequential-numbering parser in
// rule-parser.ts silently swallowed into rule codes 004-006, replacing the
// real metrics "Combined Efficiency" / "Recent Form" / "Opponent Quality").
//
// This registry answers a narrower question than recoverability
// (metric-recoverability-map.ts, which is NOT wired to production and is
// known to be out of sync with this file's code numbering — do not treat it
// as authoritative): whether a metric code is a legitimate player-comparison
// metric at all, and if it is, whether its required evidence is structurally
// impossible to obtain from the approved evidence universe.

// UNKNOWN_REQUIRES_REVIEW: mixed metrics whose definition contains both a

// RESOLVED (docs/audit-task-047-061-classification-decisions.md, 2026-08-30): both codes
// that previously lived in this array have received their human decision and are no longer
// unresolved. Neither has a record here any more -- classifyMetric's default (any code with
// no META/PROTECTED/UNKNOWN record classifies as LEGITIMATE_PLAYER_METRIC) is sufficient,
// so removing the record IS the resolution, not a separate code path.
//   - "061" (Final Advanced Tests) -- decision: SPLIT. The real Historical Twin Match Search
//     component is now code 061's entire meaning, with a real engine
//     (audit-metric-061-historical-twin-match-search.ts, wired via
//     deterministic-batch5-new-metrics.server.ts). The counterfactual/opponent-upgrade
//     rerun component is permanently EXCLUDED and deliberately given NO metric code at all
//     -- it was never a distinct catalog entry on its own, only a component of 061's
//     original mixed definition, and it duplicates in spirit code 050 ("Robustness Tests"),
//     already META_OR_NON_PLAYER above. See final-advanced-meta.server.ts's header for the
//     full before/after of this split.
//   - "047" (Uncertainty-Adjusted Advantage) -- decision: this IS a legitimate
//     player-comparison metric, not a meta-method. Applying statistical rigor (a
//     two-proportion confidence interval) to a comparison of two players' own numbers is a
//     fact about the two players' apparent edge, not a judgment about this system's own

// either aren't player facts at all or have no admissible evidence source anywhere in
// this system. "047" and "061" (UNKNOWN_REQUIRES_REVIEW) are deliberately left with
// whatever family eligibility their genuinely-reconstructable sub-component already had
// before classification review -- narrowing that further is a separate decision, not
// made here on inference alone.

// which is RESULTS_SCHEDULE-level historical-match data. (It is deliberately NOT also
// added to PBP_METRICS -- see the note there.)
// "059" ("Loss Path Probability") removed: it is META_OR_NON_PLAYER (see

// metric ("Dominance Ratio"). Neither ranking observations nor PBP can legitimately
// establish this metric's actual subject matter -- it requires genuine public
// retirement/anti-doping reporting, which protected-metric-wiring.server.ts already
// requires and validates for it (NON_RECONSTRUCTABLE_CONTEXT_CODES), and which

// already computes and targets this exact code — it was simply never allowed through this
// policy. RESULTS_SCHEDULE remains the only *sufficient* family for 021 (see below); this

// "026"/"027"/"036"/"038"/"039"/"040"/"059"/"079" were previously listed here, inherited
// from the same pre-Task-17 catalog drift as code 069 above. Their real definitions are,
// respectively: 026 "Early-Warning / Slow-Start Metrics" -- UPDATE (docs/audit-task-026-034-053.md):
// 026 now HAS a real, dedicated engine (deriveOpeningWindowProfile's first-N-games-scoped
// replay in pbp-score-state-recovery.ts, plus audit-metric-026-early-warning-slow-start.ts's
// cross-match slow-start-recovery aggregation, wired via deterministic-batch3-early-warning.
// server.ts) -- the prior "does not yet build" note is stale and corrected here. 026 still
// deliberately stays OUT of this PBP_METRICS set, though, for a narrower reason than before:
// that dedicated engine is reached through its own wired tier in warehouse-first-
// researcher.server.ts, never through the generic warehouse-level PBP path this set gates
// (deterministicPbpMetric in deterministic-pbp-metrics.server.ts, which only ever produces a
// generic "some point-by-point observations exist" summary from persisted rows, with nothing
// opening-game-specific in it) -- listing 026 here would let that unrelated generic path
// award false PARTIAL credit toward a metric it cannot actually inform, exactly the failure
// mode this comment already warns about for the other codes below. 027 "Opponent Finishing
// Ability" and 036 "Loss Autopsy Metrics"
// (both keyed off historical match *results*, e.g. lead protection, favorite status,
// loss surface -- RESULTS_SCHEDULE territory, not point chronology), 038
// "Opponent-Adjusted Residual Performance" (needs cross-player population norms), 039
// "Performance Surprise Rating" (needs a pre-match expectation/model output, not point
// data), 040 "Hidden Decline Detector" (serve-velocity/rate *trend* across recent
// matches -- velocity is not in PBP data at all, and single-match PBP cannot supply a
// cross-match trend), 059 "Loss Path Probability" (META_OR_NON_PLAYER -- gets no family
// at all), and 079 "Additional Differentiating Metrics" (coaching-visit and shot-clock
// events -- not point-by-point score state). pbp-score-state-recovery.ts already does
// not target any of these (see its TASK18B_METRIC_CODES comment); leaving them here
// would let the generic warehouse-level PBP path (deterministicPbpMetric) award false
// PARTIAL credit toward metrics PBP evidence cannot actually inform. See
// metric-classification.ts and metric-source-family-policy.test.ts.

// REAL-RESULT RESOLUTION -- the primitives that turn a finished match into a graded
// prediction observation.
//
// This module is the whole boundary between "what the engine decided" and "what actually
// happened". It is deliberately tiny and deliberately ignorant: the ONLY inputs it accepts
// are two player names, the selected player, the real winner's name, and the match's result
// status. It cannot see evidence coverage, the active-metric registry, evidence support, or
// any audit feature -- there is no parameter through which they could reach it. That is the
// point: a prediction wins because the player it named won, never because the evidence
// behind it looked good.
//
// The single rule everything else follows from: an unknown result is OPEN, never a loss.
// A match that was never played to a finish -- postponed, cancelled, abandoned, walked over,
// still scheduled -- stays open forever rather than being scored against the engine.
